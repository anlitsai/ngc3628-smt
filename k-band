optically thick: LVG model (large velocity gradiant) can explain that each molecular component has different velocity and therefore each velocity component does not obsorbe the other component


k-band: can observe star with less dust obscuration, 2.2micron
blackbody at 2micron luminosity is proportional to stellar mass

r-band


cross relation
